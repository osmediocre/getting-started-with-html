    <b><p>World Wide Web</b><p>
  The World Wide Web is made up of a collection of HTML documents. We use <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>T</b>ransfer <b>P</b>rotocol (<b>HTTP</b>) to request and download (view) these <em>web pages</em> from a server to our local machines.
  <b><p>HTML:</p></b>
  <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage is the most common document type on the internet. This is the <em>heart</em> of the web essentially. The documents are made up of text, links and markup language used to change the look and layout of the web page.<br><br>
  <b><p>HTML Tags:</b></p>
  HTML Tags are used to change text formatting (e.g. making certain text bold or italicized), to embed images, to link to other HTML <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tntOCGkgt98">pages</a> or other functions. These tags use "<" and ">" to perform these functions as web browsers like Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer are programmed to carry out the instructions that the tags indicate. An instruction such as &lt;b&gt;BOLD&lt;/b&gt; would instruct the browser to display the text as <b>BOLD</b>.<br><br>
  <em><b>Inline</b></em> HTML elements such as &lt;br&gt; will simply end a line, while <em><b>Block</b></em> elements essentially draw a box around the text from the beginning of the tag (e.g. &lt;p&gt;) to the end of a tag (e.g. &lt;/p&gt;), affecting all text in between. These "boxes" may have attributes like height or width that will affect how the text is displayed inside.<br><br>
  Computers are "<em>stupid</em>" in a sense that they need very specific instructions to carry out simple tasks, but when proper <em><b>syntax</b></em> is used the machine can carry out a given task far faster than any human. Incomplete tags such as &lt;b&gt;Text... will affect your entire document if not ended in the proper place by placing a corresponding &lt;/b&gt; tag.<br><br>
  <b><p>Conclusion:</p></b>
